Welcome to the Image Classifier developed using Python, TensorFlow and Keras. The task of classifying an image as happy or sad has been achieved by following the steps:
- Gathering and filtering dataset (happy and sad)
- Loading the data
- Preprocessing including scaling and splitting the data
- Building the CNN model
- Training the model based on training and validation data sets
- Evaluating the performance 
- Testing on new and random data set
- Saving the model

Cheers! Happy Coding :)
